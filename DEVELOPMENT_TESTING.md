# 🧪 Development Testing Guide for Notifications

## Current Status: ✅ FIXED!

The notification system has been updated to work properly in development mode with Expo Go.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed:

### 1. **Expo Go Compatibility**
- Added detection for Expo Go environment
- Graceful fallback to local notifications only
- No more crashes when push tokens aren't available

### 2. **Project ID Error**
- Added fallback for missing project ID
- Robust error handling for push token generation
- Development continues even if push tokens fail

### 3. **Development Mode Features**
- **Daily AI Insights**: Scheduled for 10 seconds in development (instead of 8 AM)
- **Test Notifications**: Work immediately in Expo Go
- **Local Notifications**: All reminder notifications work locally

## 🚀 How to Test Now:

### **1. Start the App**
```bash
npx expo start
```

### **2. Expected Console Output**
```
✅ Notifications ready! (Local notifications will work)
🧪 Development mode: AI insights notification scheduled for 10 seconds
Daily AI insights notification scheduled: [notification-id]
```

### **3. Test Daily AI Insights**
- **Automatic**: Wait 10 seconds after app launch
- **Manual**: Go to Profile → Notification Settings → "Send Test Notification"

### **4. Test Reminder Notifications**
1. Create any reminder (medication, BP, doctor, workout)
2. Set the time to 1-2 minutes from now
3. Wait for the notification to appear

### **5. Test Notification Settings**
1. Go to Profile → Notification Settings
2. Toggle different notification types
3. Use "Send Test Notification" button
4. Check permission status

## 📱 What Works in Expo Go:

### ✅ **Working Features:**
- Local notifications (scheduled notifications)
- Daily AI insights (10 seconds in dev mode)
- Reminder notifications at scheduled times
- Notification settings and toggles
- Test notifications
- Permission management

### ⚠️ **Limitations in Expo Go:**
- No remote push notifications (server-to-device)
- No push tokens for server-side notifications
- Limited to local scheduling only

### 🎯 **For Production:**
- All features will work with a development build
- Remote push notifications available
- Full push token support

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios:

### **Scenario 1: Daily AI Insights**
```
1. Launch app
2. Grant notification permissions
3. Wait 10 seconds
4. Should see: "🧠 Daily AI Health Insights"
```

### **Scenario 2: Medication Reminder**
```
1. Create medication reminder for 2 minutes from now
2. Wait for scheduled time
3. Should see: "💊 Medication Reminder - Time to take [medication]"
```

### **Scenario 3: Settings Management**
```
1. Go to Profile → Notification Settings
2. Toggle "Daily AI Insights" off
3. No more daily notifications should be scheduled
4. Toggle back on to re-enable
```

### **Scenario 4: Test Notification**
```
1. Go to Notification Settings
2. Tap "Send Test Notification"
3. Should see: "🧪 Test Notification - This is a test notification from CardioMed AI!"
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting:

### **If No Notifications Appear:**
1. Check device notification settings
2. Ensure app has notification permissions
3. Check console for error messages
4. Try the test notification button

### **If Permissions Denied:**
1. Go to device Settings → Apps → CardioMed AI → Notifications
2. Enable notifications
3. Restart the app
4. Or use "Enable Notifications" button in settings

### **Console Errors:**
- ✅ "Push token not available" = Normal in Expo Go
- ✅ "Running in Expo Go" = Expected warning
- ❌ "Permission denied" = Need to grant permissions

## 📊 Development vs Production:

| Feature | Expo Go (Dev) | Development Build | Production |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|------------|
| Local Notifications | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Daily AI Insights | ✅ (10s) | ✅ (8 AM) | ✅ (8 AM) |
| Reminder Notifications | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Push Tokens | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Remote Push | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

1. **Test immediately** with Expo Go
2. **See notifications** within seconds of app launch
